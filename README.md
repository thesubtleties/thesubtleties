# Hi, I'm Steven

Full-stack developer passionate about building elegant solutions to complex problems. I specialize in modern web technologies with a focus on creating scalable, user-centric applications.

## Long Term Project: Atria

A real event platform built by someone who actually ran events. After years of fighting with bloated event software that charged per feature and held data hostage, I built what I wished existed - a platform that respects both organizers and their communities. Self-host it and create your own branded event ecosystem (perfect for streamers, companies, or anyone wanting their own space), or use the cloud version to tap into cross-organization networking. It's completely open source because I believe nonprofits shouldn't have to choose between good tools and their budget, and organizations shouldn't need a vendor's permission to access their own data. Whether you're running a 10-person meetup or a thousand-person conference, Atria adapts to what you actually need - not what some pricing tier dictates. No feature bloat, no vendor lock-in, no surprises. Just a solid platform that puts your event first and gives you the freedom to run it your way.
